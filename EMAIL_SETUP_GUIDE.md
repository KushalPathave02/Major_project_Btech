## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
1. **Check .env configuration**
   - Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS are correct
   - Make sure no extra spaces in credentials

2. **Gmail App Password Issues**
   - Ensure 2-Step Verification is enabled
   - Generate a new App Password
   - Use the password without spaces

3. **Check Flask Server Logs**
   - Look for email-related errors in terminal
   - Error messages will indicate the issue

### Verification Link Not Working
1. **Check APP_PUBLIC_BASE_URL**
   - Must match your backend URL
   - For local: `http://localhost:5000`
   - For production: Your deployed backend URL

2. **Link Expired**
   - Links expire after 1 hour
   - User needs to register again

### User Can't Login After Registration
- User must verify email first
- Check if verification was successful
- Look for "is_verified: true" in MongoDB user document

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Practices:**

1. **Never commit `.env` file to Git**
   - Already in `.gitignore`
   - Contains sensitive credentials

2. **Use App Passwords, not main password**
   - More secure
   - Can be revoked independently

3. **Verification links expire in 1 hour**
   - Prevents old links from being used
   - Users must register again if expired

## Production Deployment

For production (Render, Heroku, etc.):

1. **Set environment variables in hosting platform**
   - Don't rely on .env file
   - Use platform's environment variable settings

2. **Update APP_PUBLIC_BASE_URL**
   ```env
   APP_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
   ```

3. **Update FRONTEND_URL**
   ```env
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.onrender.com
   ```

## Email Preview

When users receive the email, they'll see:
- Beautiful gradient background (purple)
- White card with rounded corners
- FinTrack branding
- Clear call-to-action button
- Alternative link for manual verification
- Professional design matching your app
