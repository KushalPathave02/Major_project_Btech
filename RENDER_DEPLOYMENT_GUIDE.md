# Render Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy your Financial Dashboard application on Render with both backend (Flask API) and frontend (React) services.

## Prerequisites

1. A [Render account](https://render.com) (free tier available)
2. Your code pushed to a GitHub/GitLab repository
3. MongoDB Atlas account (for the database) or existing MongoDB connection string

## Deployment Options

You have **two options** for deploying on Render:

### Option 1: Using render.yaml (Recommended - Infrastructure as Code)

This method uses the `render.yaml` file to define both services automatically.

#### Steps:

1. **Push your code to GitHub/GitLab**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Render**
   - Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
   - Click **"New +"** â†’ **"Blueprint"**
   - Connect your GitHub/GitLab account and select your repository
   - Render will detect the `render.yaml` file automatically

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   
   You'll need to set these environment variables in Render:

   **For Backend Service (financial-dashboard-api):**
   - `MONGO_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string (e.g., from MongoDB Atlas)
   - `SECRET_KEY` - A strong secret key for JWT (generate a random string)
   - `EMAIL_USER` - Your Gmail address (for email functionality)
   - `EMAIL_PASS` - Your Gmail app password (not regular password)
   - `MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER` - Same as EMAIL_USER
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key (if using AI features)
   - `FRONTEND_URL` - Will be: `https://financial-dashboard-client.onrender.com` (or your custom domain)

   **For Frontend Service (financial-dashboard-client):**
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` - Will be: `https://financial-dashboard-api.onrender.com` (your backend URL)

4. **Deploy**
   - Click "Apply" to create both services
   - Render will build and deploy both services automatically
   - Wait for the builds to complete (this may take 5-10 minutes)

---

### Option 2: Manual Deployment (Two Separate Services)

If you prefer to set up services manually:

#### Backend Deployment

1. **Create Web Service**
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Click **"New +"** â†’ **"Web Service"**
   - Connect your repository
   - Configure:
     - **Name:** `financial-dashboard-api`
     - **Runtime:** `Python 3`
     - **Build Command:** `cd flask_server && pip install -r requirements.txt`
     - **Start Command:** `cd flask_server && gunicorn app:app`
     - **Plan:** Free (or paid as needed)

2. **Set Environment Variables** (same as above)

3. **Deploy** - Click "Create Web Service"

#### Frontend Deployment

1. **Create Static Site**
   - Click **"New +"** â†’ **"Static Site"**
   - Connect the same repository
   - Configure:
     - **Name:** `financial-dashboard-client`
     - **Build Command:** `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
     - **Publish Directory:** `client/build`

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` - Your backend URL (from step 1)

3. **Deploy** - Click "Create Static Site"

---

## Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Update API URL in Frontend

If you didn't use environment variables, update the API URL in your React app:
```typescript
// In your API config file (e.g., src/config/api.ts or similar)
const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'https://financial-dashboard-api.onrender.com';
```

### 2. Set Up MongoDB Atlas (if not done already)

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create a free cluster
3. Create a database user
4. Whitelist IP address: `0.0.0.0/0` (allow access from anywhere for Render)
5. Get your connection string and add it to `MONGO_URI` in Render

### 3. Gmail App Password Setup

To enable email functionality:
1. Go to your Google Account â†’ Security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Go to "App passwords"
4. Create a new app password
5. Use this password for `EMAIL_PASS` environment variable

### 4. Get Google Gemini API Key (Optional)

If using AI features:
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create an API key
3. Add it to `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable

## Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations

- **Render Free Tier** spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after spin-down may take 30-60 seconds (cold start)
- Consider upgrading to paid tier for production use

### CORS Configuration

The backend is already configured to accept requests from Render URLs. The `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable ensures proper CORS settings.

### Database Persistence

Make sure you're using MongoDB Atlas or another cloud MongoDB instance - **do not use a local MongoDB connection** as Render services are ephemeral.

### File Uploads

The `uploads/` folder is ephemeral on Render free tier. For production, consider using:
- AWS S3
- Cloudinary
- Render Persistent Disks (paid feature)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Starting
- Check build logs in Render dashboard
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure `requirements.txt` is up to date

### Frontend Can't Connect to Backend
- Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set correctly
- Check backend service is running
- Check browser console for CORS errors

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify `MONGO_URI` is correct
- Check MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist includes `0.0.0.0/0`
- Verify database user has correct permissions

### Email Not Working
- Verify Gmail app password (not regular password)
- Check `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` are set
- Ensure 2-Step Verification is enabled on Gmail

---

## Custom Domains (Optional)

To use custom domains:
1. Go to your service in Render dashboard
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Custom Domain"
3. Add your domain and follow DNS configuration instructions

---

## Monitoring & Logs

- View logs in Render dashboard under each service
- Set up log drains for production monitoring
- Use Render's metrics to monitor performance

---

## Cost Optimization

**Free Tier:**
- Backend: 750 hours/month free
- Frontend: Unlimited bandwidth for static sites
- Database: MongoDB Atlas free tier (512MB)

**Upgrading:**
- Consider paid tier ($7/month) for always-on services
- Use persistent disk for file uploads
- Set up autoscaling for high traffic

---

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Deploy both services
2. âœ… Configure environment variables
3. âœ… Test all functionality
4. ðŸ”„ Set up monitoring
5. ðŸ”„ Configure custom domains (optional)
6. ðŸ”„ Set up CI/CD (Render auto-deploys from Git)
